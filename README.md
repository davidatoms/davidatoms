<p>AI-generated summary of my recent coding activity</p>
<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity starts -->This week I focused on wrapping up some important fixes and improvements to the booklore project, tackling everything from performance optimizations like increasing the Angular budget to more substantial backend work like improving metadata handling for non-author creator roles. I also spent time on infrastructure improvements, including a fix to disable the nginx IPv6 listener when it's disabled on the host, and strengthened the test suite by expanding coverage for several utility classes. It was a solid week of polishing both the codebase and its stability.<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity ends -->
