<p>The AI-generated summary of my recent coding activity passes my commit messages through an LLM automatically. I give up full control but can guide it through my commit messages. There is a max-tokens feature. It would take too long to copy each of them. </p>

<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity starts -->This week was pretty light on the coding front, but I did take some time to update the README with a weekly activity summary to keep things documented. It was a smaller week overall, but I wanted to make sure my project documentation stays current so anyone checking out the repo knows what's been happening.<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity ends -->
