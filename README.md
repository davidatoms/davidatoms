<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity starts -->This week I've been focused on polishing up my personal website, making several refinements to davidatoms.github.io including updating the design with some font and color tweaks, formatting the privacy policy, and keeping the date current. I also kicked off a new project by making an initial commit to the snowflake-marketplace-docs repository, which should be an exciting addition to my work going forward. It's been a good week of both maintaining and expanding my projects!<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity ends -->
