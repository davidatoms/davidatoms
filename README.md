<p>AI-generated summary of my recent coding activity</p>
<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity starts -->This past week I've been pretty productive across a few projects, with most of my focus on updating my personal website and diving into some new research work. I added some cool interactive features to davidatoms.github.io, including a dark mode toggle and an embedded Conway Game of Life video, plus I documented some interesting findings from my 3D manifold geometry work in brain-computer interfaces. On the research side, I've been setting up some new notebooks in my nejm-kumo and ai-research-code projects using Colab, which should help me scale up my experiments.<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity ends -->
