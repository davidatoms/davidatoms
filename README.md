<p>AI-generated summary of my recent coding activity</p>
<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity starts -->This past week I focused on updating the README for my zenkit-mcp project, making sure the documentation accurately reflects what I've been working on. It was a smaller week in terms of commits, but getting the documentation in order is an important foundation for making the project more accessible to others. I'm glad I took the time to keep things current and clear.<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity ends -->
