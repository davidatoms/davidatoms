<p>AI-generated summary of my recent coding activity</p>
<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity starts -->I've been pretty productive this week, pushing out 37 commits across 9 different projects with the bulk of my focus on ParticleScaling and LeanFourChainRight1. The most interesting work has been on octopus-brain, where I got the core code working and generating environments with answers for the octopus to evaluate, plus I added a gaming feature that considers three separate components like environmental stability. On the side, I've been tidying up my personal site with some housekeeping—fixing broken links, adding new articles, and reorganizing the media section—while also keeping an eye on team pull requests.<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity ends -->
