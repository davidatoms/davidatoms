<p>AI-generated summary of my recent coding activity</p>
<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity starts -->This week I was heads-down on the obsidian-mcp-server project, pushing out 28 commits across multiple repositories while primarily focusing on graph visualization features. I experimented with several approaches—building an interactive D3.js force-directed graph, an ASCII terminal version, and Mermaid-based visualizations—before ultimately refactoring to leverage Obsidian's native graph view for a cleaner solution. Beyond that, I tackled a few housekeeping items like updating my portfolio site with fresh photos and a new profile picture, while also making progress on the zeroentropy-rust project.<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity ends -->
