<p>AI-generated summary of my recent coding activity</p>
<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity starts -->This week I've been juggling updates across a few projects—mostly keeping things tidy with some housekeeping on my personal site like fixing broken links and refreshing some imagery. I also spent time on the lean4-cli toolchain, bumping it up to the latest versions to stay current with the Lean 4 ecosystem. The more interesting work happened in octopus-brain where I was documenting credits and acknowledgements, and in AEF where I've been organizing observation data and Python input files to build out CSV updates for future analysis, while also jotting down some notes on Anthropic's work.<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity ends -->
