<p>AI-generated summary of my recent coding activity</p>
<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity starts -->This past week I've been focused on enhancing the Kamon project by developing and integrating a synthetic data set along with the necessary training and evaluation hooks to work with it, which should help streamline our model development pipeline. I also knocked out some type errors in the treequest repository and contributed to a few infrastructure improvements across other projects, including custom cache configuration options and some refactoring work on user agent handling. It's been a solid week of grinding through both feature development and technical debt reduction.<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity ends -->
