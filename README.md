<p>AI-generated summary of my recent coding activity</p>
<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity starts -->This past week I've been pretty productive across a few projects, making 38 commits mostly focused on my main repositories. The highlight has been some significant work on obsidian-mcp-server where I've been iterating on graph visualization features—I experimented with custom D3.js force-directed graphs and ASCII terminal visualizations before ultimately simplifying to leverage Obsidian's native graph view, which turned out to be the better approach. On the davidatoms side, I've been cleaning up my CI/CD workflows, fixing some prompt formatting issues to keep my automated summaries clean, and updating documentation along the way. I also wrapped up an issue and managed a pull request, so it's been a solid week of both feature work and maintenance to keep things running smoothly.<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity ends -->
