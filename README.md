<p>AI-generated summary of my recent coding activity</p>
<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity starts -->I've been diving deep into some fascinating research on latency and correctness in neural networks this week, exploring how these principles might manifest across both artificial and biological systems. Most of my work went into my personal site, where I spent a lot of time debugging and refining my working theory on latency-correctness manifolds. It was one of those weeks where iteration and refinement were key—lots of debugging cycles, but I feel like I'm getting closer to solidifying the core concepts.<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity ends -->
