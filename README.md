<p>AI-generated summary of my recent coding activity</p>
<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity starts -->This week I've been focused on fixing bugs across a couple of projects—mostly squashing issues in win11debloat around script exit handling and folder properties permissions, while also making solid progress on device-activity-tracker where I cleaned up vulnerabilities and improved device tracking in standby mode. The most satisfying part was getting device-activity-tracker in better shape; it's kind of funny that this POC now has fewer security vulnerabilities than WhatsApp itself! I also wrapped up some documentation updates on neurodiscoverybench, so while it was a quieter week overall, I managed to ship some meaningful fixes and improvements.<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity ends -->
