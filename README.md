<p>AI-generated summary of my recent coding activity</p>
<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity starts -->This week I've been pretty prolific with 33 commits across my projects, spending most of my time on my personal site and the davidatoms repository. I refreshed my online presence with a new profile picture and added some fresh content to my blog, while also fine-tuning the layout and spacing on my README to make everything look cleaner and more polished. I wrapped up an issue and kept the momentum going across a few other repositories, including some work on the obsidian-mcp-server project.<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity ends -->
