<p>AI-generated summary of my recent coding activity</p>
<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity starts -->This week I've been focused on getting two new projects off the ground, with most of my energy going into edgar-kumo where I've added comprehensive source code, documentation, and visualizations to make the project presentable and maintainable. I also spent time setting up proper repository hygiene by creating thoughtful .gitignore files and README documentation across both projects to protect sensitive credentials and give contributors a clear entry point. It was a solid week of laying strong foundational work that should make these projects much easier to develop and share going forward.<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity ends -->
