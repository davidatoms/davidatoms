<!-- About me -->
### David's Blurbs
I'm David Adams. I am a second year master's degree student of financial economics at Johns Hopkins University. I ski, mountain bike, and travel. I am from Alpine, Utah, and love the mountains and the community. Growing up, my dad worked as a consultant and invested in real estate, stocks, and private enterprises. I grew to love that and how people interact through business. During COVID-19, I took a coding boot camp at Columbia University's school for data science and have been coding ever since.
