<p>The AI-generated summary of my recent coding activity passes my commit messages through an LLM automatically. I give up full control but can guide it through my commit messages. There is a max-tokens feature. It would take too long to copy each of them. </p>

<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity starts -->This past week I focused on documentation and attribution work across my projects. I enhanced the README in my davidatoms repository with a detailed summary of recent activity, making it easier for others to understand what I've been working on. I also made sure to properly credit the Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization methodology in another project, recognizing the importance of giving credit where it's due in collaborative research spaces.<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity ends -->
