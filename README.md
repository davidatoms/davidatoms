<p>The AI-generated summary of my recent coding activity passes my commit messages through an LLM automatically. I give up full control but can guide it through my commit messages. There is a max-tokens feature. It would take too long to copy each of them. </p>

<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity starts -->This week I focused on improving the cutile-python project with some foundational changes to how we handle operations and control flow. I introduced a BlockRestriction interface to give us better control over which operations are allowed inside blocks, refactored our Operations to use dataclasses for cleaner code, and added support for static iteration with tuple concatenation to make the API more flexible. I also tackled some compatibility work to ensure we're ready for Python 3.12 and fixed a helper function that had issues with while loops and returns. While it was a quieter week activity-wise, these changes lay important groundwork for more robust and maintainable code going forward.<!-- ai_generated_summary_recent_activity ends -->
