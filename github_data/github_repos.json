Record your life, remember people you meet, identify objects, translate text, and more.\n\n![OpenGlass](https://github.com/BasedHardware/OpenGlass/assets/43514161/2fdc9d9d-2206-455c-ba60-10dbd6fb3dfb)\n\n\n## Video Demo\n\n[![OpenGlass Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/DsM_-c2e1ew/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/DsM_-c2e1ew)\n\n## Want a Pre-built Version?\n\nWe will ship a limited number of pre-built kits. Fill out the [interest form](https://basedhardware.com/openglass) to get notified.\n\n## Community\n\nJoin the [Based Hardware Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ZutWMTJnwA) for setup questions, contribution guide, and more.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFollow these steps to set up OpenGlass:\n\n### Hardware\n\n1. Gather the required components:\n   - [Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32 S3 Sense](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C69FFVHH/ref=dp_iou_view_item?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\n   - [EEMB LP502030 3.7v 250mAH battery](https://www.amazon.com/EEMB-Battery-Rechargeable-Lithium-Connector/dp/B08VRZTHDL)\n   - [3D printed glasses mount case](https://storage.googleapis.com/scott-misc/openglass_case.stl)\n\n2. 3D print the glasses mount case using the provided STL file.\n\n3. Open the [firmware folder](https://github.com/BasedHardware/openglass/tree/main/firmware) and open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.\n   - If you don't have the Arduino IDE installed, download and install it from the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).\n   - Alternatively, follow the steps in the [firmware readme](firmware/readme.md) to build using `arduino-cli`\n\n4. Follow the software preparation steps to set up the Arduino IDE for the XIAO ESP32S3 board:\n   - Add ESP32 board package to your Arduino IDE:\n     - Navigate to File > Preferences, and fill \"Additional Boards Manager URLs\" with the URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json`\n     - Navigate to Tools > Board > Boards Manager..., type the keyword `esp32` in the search box, select the latest version of `esp32`, and install it.\n   - Select your board and port:\n     - On top of the Arduino IDE, select the port (likely to be COM3 or higher).\n     - Search for `xiao` in the development board on the left and select `XIAO_ESP32S3`.\n\n5. Before you flash go to the \"Tools\" drop down in the Arduino IDE and make sure you set \"PSRAM:\" to be \"PSRAM: \"OPI PSRAM\"\n\n![Like this](image.png)\n\n6. Upload the firmware to the XIAO ESP32S3 board.\n\n### Software\n\n1. Clone the OpenGlass repository and install the dependencies:\n   ```\n   git clone https://github.com/BasedHardware/openglass.git\n   cd openglass\n   npm install\n   ```\n   You can also use **yarn** to install, by doing\n   ```\n   yarn install\n   ```\n\n3. Add API keys for Groq and OpenAI in the `keys.ts` file located at [https://github.com/BasedHardware/OpenGlass/blob/main/sources/keys.ts](https://github.com/BasedHardware/OpenGlass/blob/main/sources/keys.ts).\n\n4. For Ollama, self-host the REST API from the repository at [https://github.com/ollama/ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) and add the URL to the `keys.ts` file. The URL should be http://localhost:11434/api/chat\n5. go to terminal and type \"ollama pull moondream:1.8b-v2-fp16\"\n\n\n6. Start the application:\n   ```\n   npm start\n   ```\n\n   If using **yarn** start the application with\n   ```\n   yarn start\n   ```\n\n   Note: This is an Expo project. For now, open the localhost link (this will appear after completing step 5) to access the web version.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n## [\u2139\ufe0f \ud83d\udd34 We moved this project to Omi repository.

Not only do we work on code and issues here, we also publish our [roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Roadmap), [monthly iteration plans](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Iteration-Plans), and our [endgame plans](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Running-the-Endgame). This source code is available to everyone under the standard [MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).\n\n## Visual Studio Code\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img alt=\"VS Code in action\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35271042/118224532-3842c400-b438-11eb-923d-a5f66fa6785a.png\">\n</p>\n\n[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a distribution of the `Code - OSS` repository with Microsoft-specific customizations released under a traditional [Microsoft product license](https://code.visualstudio.com/License/).\n\n[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.\n\nVisual Studio Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux on [Visual Studio Code's website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). To get the latest releases every day, install the [Insiders build](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThere are many ways in which you can participate in this project, for example:\n\n* [Submit bugs and feature requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues), and help us verify as they are checked in\n* Review [source code changes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pulls)\n* Review the [documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs) and make pull requests for anything from typos to additional and new content\n\nIf you are interested in fixing issues and contributing directly to the code base,\nplease see the document [How to Contribute](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute), which covers the following:\n\n* [How to build and run from source](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute)\n* [The development workflow, including debugging and running tests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#debugging)\n* [Coding guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Coding-Guidelines)\n* [Submitting pull requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#pull-requests)\n* [Finding an issue to work on](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#where-to-contribute)\n* [Contributing to translations](https://aka.ms/vscodeloc)\n\n## Feedback\n\n* Ask a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode)\n* [Request a new feature](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* Upvote [popular feature requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)\n* [File an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues)\n* Connect with the extension author community on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-discussions/discussions) or [Slack](https://aka.ms/vscode-dev-community)\n* Follow [@code](https://twitter.com/code) and let us know what you think!\n\nSee our [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Feedback-Channels) for a description of each of these channels and information on some other available community-driven channels.\n\n## Related Projects\n\nMany of the core components and extensions to VS Code live in their own repositories on GitHub. For example, the [node debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-debug) and the [mono debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mono-debug) repositories are separate from each other. For a complete list, please visit the [Related Projects](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) page on our [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki).\n\n## Bundled Extensions\n\nVS Code includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (code completion, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix `language-features`. For example, the `json` extension provides coloring for `JSON` and the `json-language-features` extension provides rich language support for `JSON`.\n\n## Development Container\n\nThis repository includes a Visual Studio Code Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container.\n\n* For [Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers), use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.\n  * If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can also click [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) to get started. This will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.\n\n* For Codespaces, install the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension in VS Code, and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.\n\nDocker / the Codespace should have at least **4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)** to run full build. See the [development container README](.devcontainer/README.md) for more information.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

Check out [LangChain.js](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs).\n\nLangChain is a framework for building LLM-powered applications. It helps you chain\ntogether interoperable components and third-party integrations to simplify AI\napplication development \u2014  all while future-proofing decisions as the underlying\ntechnology evolves.\n\n```bash\npip install -U langchain\n```\n\nTo learn more about LangChain, check out\n[the docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/). If you\u2019re looking for more\nadvanced customization or agent orchestration, check out\n[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/), our framework for building\ncontrollable agent workflows.\n\n## Why use LangChain?\n\nLangChain helps developers build applications powered by LLMs through a standard\ninterface for models, embeddings, vector stores, and more. \n\nUse LangChain for:\n- **Real-time data augmentation**. Easily connect LLMs to diverse data sources and\nexternal / internal systems, drawing from LangChain\u2019s vast library of integrations with\nmodel providers, tools, vector stores, retrievers, and more.\n- **Model interoperability**. Swap models in and out as your engineering team\nexperiments to find the best choice for your application\u2019s needs. As the industry\nfrontier evolves, adapt quickly \u2014 LangChain\u2019s abstractions keep you moving without\nlosing momentum.\n\n## LangChain\u2019s ecosystem\nWhile the LangChain framework can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly\nwith any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools when building LLM\napplications. \n\nTo improve your LLM application development, pair LangChain with:\n\n- [LangSmith](http://www.langchain.com/langsmith) - Helpful for agent evals and\nobservability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain\nvisibility in production, and improve performance over time.\n- [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) - Build agents that can\nreliably handle complex tasks with LangGraph, our low-level agent orchestration\nframework. LangGraph offers customizable architecture, long-term memory, and\nhuman-in-the-loop workflows \u2014 and is trusted in production by companies like LinkedIn,\nUber, Klarna, and GitLab.\n- [LangGraph Platform](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/#langgraph-platform) - Deploy\nand scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long\nrunning, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across\nteams \u2014 and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in\n[LangGraph Studio](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_studio/).\n\n## Additional resources\n- [Tutorials](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/): Simple walkthroughs with\nguided examples on getting started with LangChain.\n- [How-to Guides](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/): Quick, actionable code\nsnippets for topics such as tool calling, RAG use cases, and more.\n- [Conceptual Guides](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/): Explanations of key\nconcepts behind the LangChain framework.\n- [API Reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/): Detailed reference on\nnavigating base packages and integrations for LangChain.\n"
