    "readme": "## Mailspring Plugin Starter\n\nThis folder contains a sample plugin for Mailspring that adds components to the composer's \"action bar\" and the right sidebar shown in the message viewer.\n\n## Building a Plugin\n\nCopy or symlink this project into `~/Library/Application Support/Mailspring/packages` on MacOS, or the corresponding location on Windows and Linux. (You can find this directory by going to _Developer > Show Mailsync Logs_ in Mailspring).\n\nYou can rename this directory and change the `name` field of `package.json` to rename your plugin. Keep in mind that plugins are like node modules and the names cannot contain spaces!\n\nTo get started, run `npm install` in your plugin's directory and then `npm run-script build` to compile the `src` folder into the `lib` folder. To see your changes in Mailspring, quit and relaunch the app OR open the developer tools and reload the app's main window.\n\nFor documentation of how to build plugins, check out [https://foundry376.github.io/Mailspring/](https://foundry376.github.io/Mailspring/) for (slightly outdated) information and also have a look at the many plugins that ship within the core app: [https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/tree/master/app/internal_packages](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/tree/master/app/internal_packages). Some of the bundled plugins, like `composer-translate`, `composer-templates`, and `phishing-detection` are great starting points!\n\n## Shipping a Plugin\n\nMailspring does not transpile the source code in your plugin when it runs - it expects that your JSX files, TypeScript, etc. has already been converted to plain ES2017 JavaScript. To give your plugin to other people, you should commit the `lib` directory so that they can download the repository, put it in place via the \"Install a Plugin...\" menu item in Mailspring, and be done.\n\n## Future\n\nIn the next year or so, we'll be launching a first-class \"plugin gallery\" in Mailspring and formalizing the development and release processes. Right now, building a plugin using TypeScript is a real pain because Mailspring - while written in TypeScript - doesn't export the types for you to build against. Stay tuned!\n\n## A note about Node Modules\n\nRight now, if your plugin depends on external node modules (say, a CSV parser like `node-csv`), you'd need to package up a zip file that contained those modules already installed in `node_modules`, or have your users run `npm install`. In the future, Mailspring will run npm install for you.\n\nHowever, we do not plan to support Mailspring plugins that require _native_ node modules - the kind that compile C++ or C code into platform-specific binaries. It's really hard to ship all of the tooling required to build these reliably, pre-packing them for each platform is annoying, and they often break when the node / nan versions change. Be warned! (An example of this would be `sqlite` or something like `node-addressbook`. You can often tell if a module contains native code if there is a `binding.gyp` file or if the install process takes a while and calls out to `make` or `gcc`.)\n"

It's faster, leaner, and shipping today!** It replaces the JavaScript sync code in Nylas Mail with a new C++ sync engine based on [Mailcore2](https://github.com/MailCore/mailcore2). It uses roughly half the RAM and CPU of Nylas Mail and idles with almost zero \"CPU Wakes\", which translates to great battery life. It also has an entirely revamped composer and other great new features.\n\nMailspring's UI is open source (GPLv3) and written in TypeScript with [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - it's built on a plugin architecture and was designed to be easy to extend. Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started!\n\nMailspring's sync engine is spawned by the Electron application and runs locally on your computer. [It is open source (GPLv3) and written in C++ and C.](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Sync) For convenience, however, when you set up your development environment, Mailspring uses the latest version of the sync engine we've shipped for your platform so you don't need to pull sources or install its compile-time dependencies.\n\n![Mailspring Screenshot](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring/raw/master/screenshots/hero_graphic_mac%402x.png)\n\n## Features\n\nMailspring comes packed with powerful features like Unified Inbox, Snooze, Send\nLater, Mail Rules, Templates and more. Mailspring Pro, which you can unlock\nwith a monthly subscription, adds even more features for people who send a ton\nof email: link tracking, read receipts, mailbox analytics, contact and company\nprofiles. **All of these features run in the client - Mailspring does not send\nyour email credentials to the cloud.** For a full list of features, check out\n[getmailspring.com](https://getmailspring.com/).\n\n## Download Mailspring\n\nYou can download compiled versions of Mailspring for Windows, Mac OS X, and\nLinux (deb, rpm and snap) from\n[https://getmailspring.com/download](https://getmailspring.com/download).\n\n## Getting Help\n\nYou can find community-based help and discussion with other Mailspring users on our\n[Discourse community](https://community.getmailspring.com/).\n\n## Contributing\n\nMailspring is entirely open-source.

It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.* <br><be>\n\n*Theoretically, the Game of Life has the power of a universal Turing machine: anything that can be computed algorithmically can be computed within the Game of Life.* <br><br>\n\n### Game rules:\nThe evolution of the game board from one cycle to the next is governed by a set of simple rules:<br>\n- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n<br>\n\n## This project\nThis project is a lightweight (semi-)interactive implementation of Conway's game of life written in C that (currently) runs in the terminal. The game consists of an input phase during which the user can arrange the initial state of the board and adjust game parameters (board size, update rate, board geometry, maximum iterations) followed by the fully automated game phase.\n\nBoth game phases use 2 threads: one to handle output and one to handle other game tasks (reading and implementing user input in the first phase, and updating the game board in the second phase). Updates are currently done using a naive algorithm (simply counting living neighbours for each tile). A simple early stopping mechanism also detects when the board has reached a steady state.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/AWikramanayake/conway-game-of-life/blob/main/misc/Gosper%20glider%20gun.gif\" width=\"720\"/>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nExample 2: Gosper's Glider Gun</br>\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/AWikramanayake/conway-game-of-life/blob/main/misc/Gosper%20glider%20gun%20toroidal.gif\" width=\"720\"/>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nBlooper: Gosper's Glider Gun with toroidal board geometry</p></br><br>\n\nSimkin's glider gun (example 1) and Gosper's glider gun (example 2) are implementations of periodic signal emitters that can be created using the game's simple rules. These can be combined with signal eaters, negators, reflectors, etc to create logic gates, hence why the game is Turing complete.\n\n\n### Next steps:\n- Add linux support (the project currently uses Sleep() from windows.h to cap output refresh rate) and create a makefile\n- Allow the user to pause the game during the second phase and return to the input phase to change board state/game parameters\n- Use a hash table to compare the board state to recent previous states to detect when the board has entered a loop state.\n- Implement a more efficient update algorithms that uses a bitmap and bitshift operations to operate on multiple tiles directly.\n"

Choreographic programming is a programming paradigm where you specify the interactions between different entities in a concurrent system in one global view, and then *extract implementations* for each of those actors. See [\u00a7 Bibliography](#org44e5aee) for references on choreographic programming in general.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nChorex is available on Hex.pm. Install by including the following in your `mix.exs` file under the `deps` list:\n\n```elixir\ndef deps do\n  [\n    ...,\n    {:chorex, \"~> 0.9.0\"},\n    ...\n  ]\nend\n```\n\nYou can install development versions of Chorex directly from GitHub like so:\n\n```elixir\ndef deps do\n  [\n    ...,\n    {:chorex, github: \"utahplt/chorex\"},\n    ...\n  ]\nend\n```\n\nAdd `Chorex.Registry` to your application setup:\n\n```elixir\n# part of application startup; e.g. in a Phoenix application this\n# would be in MyApp.Application located at lib/my_app/application.ex\nchildren = [\n  {Registry, name: Chorex.Registry, keys: :unique}\n]\n```\n\nNote that this is *experimental software* and stuff *will* break. Please don't rely on this for anything production-grade. Not yet at least.\n\n\n## What is a choreography?\n\nA choreography is a birds-eye view of an interaction between nodes in a distributed system. You have some set of *actors*\u2014in Elixir parlance processes\u2014that exchange *messages* while also running some *local computation*\u2014i.e. functions that don't rely on talking to other nodes in the system.\n\nLindsey Kuper's research group has put together [a delightful zine explaining choreographic programming](https://decomposition.al/zines/#communicating-chorrectly-with-a-choreography). Check that out if you are new to choreographies.\n\nAt a high-level, Chorex lets you build choreographies to describe different interactions between components of your system. Chorex focuses on the communication flow; you still implement the computation that runs locally on each node, but you don't have to worry about writing `send`s between nodes.\n\n<!-- FIXME: link the examples repo here -->\nOnce you have a choreography, you can *instantiate* it any number of times as you like. You might want, for example, to have one choreography describing how a user actor would communicate to create an account on a system, and then another choreography for how an existing user would log in with previously established credentials.\n\n\n## Choreography syntax\n\nChorex introduces some new Elixir syntax for choreographies. Here's a breakdown of how it works.\n\nStart by creating a module to hold the choreography, say `import Chorex`, and add a `defchor` block:\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule MyCoolChoreography do\n  import Chorex\n\n  defchor [Actor1, Actor2, ...] do\n    ...choreography body...\n  end\nend\n```\n\n(Note: in addition to the choreography definition here, you will need to make a module for each actor. We'll focus on the special syntax of the `defchor` block in this section, but later you'll see how to built a module for each of the `Actor1`, `Actor2`, etc.)\n\nThe `defchor` macro wraps a choreography and translates it into core Elixir code. You give `defchor` a list of actors, specified as if they were module names, and then a `do` block wraps the choreography body.\n\nThe body of the choreography is a set of functions. One function named `run` must be present: this serves as the entry point into the choreography. The arguments to `run` come from the third argument to the `Chorex.start` function and are how you typically get values into an instantiation of a choreography. (More on `Chorex.start` and function parameters in a minute.)\n\n```elixir\ndefchor [Actor1, Actor2, ...] do\n  def some_func(...) do\n    ...\n  end\n\n  def run() do\n    ...\n  end\nend\n```\n\n\n### Message passing expressions\n\nInside the body of functions you can write message delivery expressions. Examples:\n\n```elixir\nActor1.(var1) ~> Actor2.(var2_a)\nActor1.func_1() ~> Actor2.(var2_b)\nActor1.func_2(var1_a, var1_b) ~> Actor2.(var2_c)\nActor1.(var1_a + var1_b) ~> Actor2.(var2_c)\n```\n\nFormal syntax:\n\n```bnf\n  msg_delivery ::= $local_exp ~> $actor.($pat)\n\n  local_exp    ::= $actor.($pat)\n                 | $actor.$func($exp, ...)\n                 | $actor.($exp)\n\n  actor        ::= Module name         (e.g. Actor)\n  func         ::= Function name       (e.g. frobnicate(...))\n  pat          ::= Pattern match expr  (e.g. a variable like `foo` or tuples `{:ok, bar}` etc.)\n  exp          ::= Elixir expression   (e.g. foo + sum([1, 2, 3]))\n```\n\nThe `~>` indicates sending a message between actors. The left-hand-side must be `Actor1.<something>`, where that `<something>` bit can be one of three things:\n\n1.  A variable local to Actor1\n2.  A function local to Actor1 (with or without arguments, also all local to Actor1)\n3.  An expression local to Actor1\n\nThe right-hand-side must be `Actor2.(<pattern>)`. This means that the left-hand-side will be computed on `Actor1` and send to `Actor2` where it will be matched against the pattern `pattern`.\n\n\n### Local expressions\n\n*Local expressions* are computations that happen on a single node. These computations are isolated from each other\u2014i.e. every location has its own variables. For example, if I say:\n\n```elixir\ndefchor [Holmes, Watson] do\n  def discombobulate(Holmes.(clue)) do\n    ...\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThen inside the body of that function, I can talk about the variable `clue` which is located on the `Holmes` node. I can't, for instance, talk about the variable `clue` on the `Watson` node.\n\n```elixir\nHolmes.(clue + 1)    # fine\nWatson.(clue * 2)    # error: variable `clue` not defined\n```\n\nI can *send* the value in Holmes' `clue` variable to Watson, at which point Watson can do computation with the value:\n\n```elixir\nHolmes.(clue) ~> Watson.(holmes_observes)\n\nif Watson.remember(holmes_observes) do\n  ...\nelse\n  ...\nend\n```\n\nThe `remember` function here will be defined on the the implementation for the `Watson` actor.\n\n**ACHTUNG!! `mix format` will rewrite `Actor1.var1` to `Actor1.var1()` which is a function call instead of a variable! Wrap variables in parens like `Actor1.(var1)` if you want to use `mix format`!** This is an unfortunate drawback\u2014suggestions on fixing this would be welcome.\n\nLocal functions are not defined as part of the choreography; instead, you implement these in a separate Elixir module. More on that later.\n\n\n### `if` expressions and knowledge of choice broadcasting\n\n```elixir\nif Actor1.make_decision(), notify: [Actor2] do\n  ...\nelse\n  ...\nend\n```\n\n`if` expressions are supported. Some actor makes a choice of which branch to go down. It is then *crucial* that that deciding actor inform all other actors about the choice of branch with the special `notify: [Actor2, Actor3, ...]` syntax. If this is omitted, *all* actors will be informed, which may lead to more messages being sent than necessary.\n\n\n### Function syntax\n\n```elixir\ndefchor [Alice, Bob] do\n  def run(Alice.(msg)) do\n    with Bob.({pub, priv}) <- Bob.gen_key() do\n      Bob.(pub) ~> Alice.(key)\n      exchange_message(Alice.encrypt(msg <> \"\\n  love, Alice\", key), Bob.(priv))\n    end\n  end\n\n  def exchange_message(Alice.(enc_msg), Bob.(priv)) do\n    Alice.(enc_msg) ~> Bob.(enc_msg)\n    Alice.(:letter_sent)\n    Bob.decrypt(enc_msg, priv)\n  end\nend\n```\n\nChoreographies support functions and function calls\u2014even recursive ones. Function parameters need to be annotated with the actor they live at, and the arguments when calling the function need to match. Calling a function with the wrong actor will result in the parameter getting `nil`. E.g. calling `exchange_message` above like so will not work properly:\n\n```elixir\nexchange_message(Bob.(msg), Alice.(priv))\n```\n\n(and not just because the variables are wrong\u2014the actor names don't match so the parameters won't get the values they need).\n\n\n### Higher-order choreographies\n\n```elixir\ndef higher_order_chor(other_chor) do\n  ... other_chor.(...) ...\nend\n```\n\nChorex supports higher-order choreographies. This means you can pass the functions defined *inside the `defchor` block* around as you would with functions. Higher-order choreographic functions *don't* get an actor prefix and you call them as you would a function bound to a variable, like so:\n\n```elixir\ndefchor [Actor, OtherActor] do\n  def higher_order_chor(other_chor) do\n    ... other_chor.(...) ...\n  end\n\n  def some_local_chor(Actor.(var_name)) do\n    Actor.(var_name) ~> OtherActor.(other_var)\n    OtherActor.(other_var)\n  end\n\n  def run() do\n    higher_order_chor(@some_local_chor/1)\n  end\nend\n```\n\nNote that when referring to the function, you **must** use the `@func_name/3` syntax\u2014the Chorex compiler notices the `@` and processes the function reference differently. This is because the functions defined with `def` inside the `defchor` block have private internal details (when Chorex builds them, they get special implicit arguments added) and Chorex needs to handle references to these functions specially.\n\n\n### Variable binding\n\n```elixir\nwith OtherActor.(other_var) <- other_chor.(Actor.(var)) do\n  ...\nend\n```\n\nYou can bind the result of some expression to a variable/pattern at an actor with `with`. In the case of a higher-order choreography (seen above) this is whatever was on node `OtherActor` when `other_chor` executed. You may also use `with` for binding local expressions, as seen in the `exchange_message` example under \u00a7 Function syntax.\n\n\n### Error recovery\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule Bookstore do\n  import Chorex\n\n  defchor [Buyer, Seller, Contributor] do\n    def run() do\n      Buyer.get_book_title() ~> Seller.(book)\n      Seller.get_price(book) ~> Buyer.(price)\n      Seller.get_price(book) ~> Contributor.(price)\n\n      checkpoint do\n        Contributor.compute_contribution(price) ~> Buyer.(extra_money) # might blow up\n\n        if Buyer.in_budget(price - extra_money) do\n          ...\n        else\n          ...\n        end\n      rescue\n        if Buyer.in_budget(price) do # no extra money!\n          Buyer.(\"thanks anyway\") ~> Contributor.(thank_you_note)\n          ...\n        else\n          ...\n        end\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nChorex supports exceptions in the form of actors crashing. In the above example, suppose the function `compute_contribution` is known to possibly crash at runtime. In accordance with the Erlang/Elixir philosophy of \"let it crash\", suppose we would rather recover from this crash than harden the `Contributor` actor to prevent crashes.\n\nIn the case of a crash inside the `checkpoint` block, the crasher will get restarted, and all actors will abort execution of the `checkpoint` block and move to the `rescue` block.\n\n\n## Creating a choreography: `defchor` + actor implementations\n\nTo create a choreography, start by making a module, and writing the choreography with the `defchor` macro.\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule Bookstore do\n  import Chorex\n\n  defchor [Actor1, Actor2] do\n    def run() do\n      Actor1.(... some expr ...) ~> Actor2.(some_var)\n      Actor2.some_computation(some_var) ~> Actor1.(the_result)\n      ...\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nYou will need to make a module for every actor you specify at the beginning of `defchor` and mark which actor you're implementing like so:\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule MyFirstActor do\n  use Bookstore.Chorex, Actor1\n\n  ...\nend\n\ndefmodule MySecondActor do\n  use Bookstore.Chorex, Actor2\n\n  def some_computation(val), do: ...\nend\n```\n\nThese modules will need to implement all of the local functions specified in the choreography. Chorex will use Elixir's behaviour mechanism to warn you if you don't implement every function needed. In the above example, the `MySecondActor` implements the role of `Actor2` in the choreography, and therefore needs to implement the `some_computation` function.\n\n**Note:** *Actor names do not need to be the same as the modules implementing them!* It is *useful* to do that, but there exist instances where you might want to write one choreography and implement it in different ways.\n\n\n## Running a choreography\n\nYou need three things to fire off a choreography:\n\n1. The choreography description\n2. An implementation for each of the actors\n3. A call to `Chorex.start`\n\nUse the `Chorex.start/3` function to start a choreography:\n\n```elixir\nChorex.start(MyChoreography.Chorex,\n             %{ Actor1 => MyActor1Impl,\n                Actor2 => MyActor2Impl },\n             [args, to, run])\n```\n\nThe arguments are as follows:\n\n 1. The name of the `Chorex` module to use. (The `defchor` macro creates this module for you; in the above example there is a `MyChoreography` module with a top-level `defchor` declaration that creates the `Chorex` submodule on expansion.)\n 2. A map from actor name to implementation module name.\n 3. A list of arguments to the `run` function in the Choreography. These will automatically get sent to the right nodes.\n\nOnce the actors are done, they will send the last value they computed to the current process tagged with the actor they were implementing. So, for this example, you could see what `Actor1` computed by awaiting:\n\n```elixir\nreceive do\n  {:chorex_return, Actor1, val} -> IO.inspect(val, label: \"Actor1's return: \")\nend\n```\n\n\n## Using a choreography with the rest of your project\n\nThe local functions are free to call any other code you have\u2014they're just normal Elixir. If that code sends and receives messages not managed by the choreography library, there is no guarantee that this will be deadlock-free.\n\n\n# Development\n\nChorex is under active development and things will change and break rapidly.\n\nIf you find any bugs or would like to suggest a feature, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/utahplt/chorex/issues).\n\n## Changelog\n\nWe will collect change descriptions here until we come up with a more stable format when changes get bigger.\n\n - v0.9.0, 2025-09-10\n \n   Incorporate suggestions from Jos\u00e9:\n   \n   + [x] Rename `try/rescue` to `checkpoint/rescue` to make it less distasteful to `try`-shy Elixir developers.\n   + [x] Use full actor name instead of snake-case atom in `use MyChor.Chorex, ActorName`\n\n   Note that these changes are backwards-compatible (for now) so you can still use `try/rescue` or the old `use MyChor.Chorex, :actorname` syntax. Going forward, prefer `checkpoint` and the CamelCase actor role name.\n\n - v0.8.14, 2025-05-30\n \n   Recovering also restores process variables.\n\n - v0.8.13, 2025-05-30\n\n   Recovering unwinds all the way up to corresponding barrier.\n\n - v0.8.12, 2025-05-30\n\n   Bug fixes around variables and continuation frames.\n\n - v0.8.11, 2025-05-30\n\n   Don't store actor's mailbox.\n\n - v0.8.10, 2025-05-02\n\n   Monitor sets barrier map all to `false` instead of deleting entirely.

Lots of rough edges so please, be patient. :)\n\n\n## High-level internals\n\nThe `defchor` macro is implemented in the `Chorex` module.\n\n-   The `defchor` macro gathers a list of actors.\n-   For each actor, call `project` on the body of the choreography. The `project` function keeps track of the current actor as the `label` variable. (This vernacular borrowed from the academic literature.)\n-   The functions `project` and `project_sequence` are mutually recursive: `project_sequence` gets invoked whenever `project` encounters a block with multiple instructions.\n-   The `project` function walks the AST, it gathers a list of functions that will need to be implemented by each actor's implementing module, as well as a list of top-level functions for each projection.\n    -   This gathering is handled by the `WriterMonad` module, which provides the `monadic do ... end` form as well as `return` and `mzero`.\n-   Finally the macro generates modules for each actor under the `Chorex` module it generates.\n\n\nEach actor projects to GenServer. The GenServer maintains some state at runtime: most importantly, it tracks the function call stack and an inbox of pending Chorex messages.\n\n\n## Testing\n\nSimply clone the repository and run `mix test`.\n\n\n<a id=\"org44e5aee\"></a>\n\n# Bibliography\n\n-   Hirsch & Garg (2022-01-16) *Pirouette: Higher-Order Typed Functional Choreographies*, Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages. <https://doi.org/10.1145/3498684>\n\n-   Lugovi\u0107 & Montesi (2023-10-15) *Real-World Choreographic Programming: Full-Duplex Asynchrony and Interoperability*, The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming. <https://doi.org/10.22152/programming-journal.org/2024/8/8>\n\n\n# Authors\n\nThis is a project by the [Utah PLT](https://github.com/utahplt) group.

Configuration\n\nxleak supports configuration via a TOML file for persistent settings like default theme and keybindings.\n\n### Config File Location\n\n**Default:** `~/.config/xleak/config.toml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xleak/config.toml`)\n\n**Platform-specific fallback locations:**\n- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/xleak/config.toml`\n- **Linux:** `~/.config/xleak/config.toml` (same as XDG)\n- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\\xleak\\config.toml`\n\n**Custom:** Use `--config` flag to specify a different location:\n```bash\nxleak --config /path/to/config.toml file.xlsx -i\n```\n\n### Quick Start\n\n1. **Copy the example:**\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p ~/.config/xleak\n   cp config.toml.example ~/.config/xleak/config.toml\n   ```\n\n2. **Or create a minimal config:**\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p ~/.config/xleak\n   cat > ~/.config/xleak/config.toml << 'EOF'\n   [theme]\n   default = \"Dracula\"\n\n   [ui]\n   max_rows = 50\n   column_width = 30\n\n   [keybindings]\n   profile = \"vim\"\n   EOF\n   ```\n\n3. **Test your config:**\n   ```bash\n   xleak file.xlsx -i\n   ```\n\n### Configuration Options\n\n#### Theme Settings\n\n```toml\n[theme]\n# Default theme to use on startup\ndefault = \"Dracula\"\n```\n\n**Available themes:**\n- `\"Default\"` - Clean light theme with subtle colors\n- `\"Dracula\"` - Popular dark theme with purple accents\n- `\"Solarized Dark\"` - Precision colors for machines and people\n- `\"Solarized Light\"` - Light variant of Solarized\n- `\"GitHub Dark\"` - GitHub's dark color scheme\n- `\"Nord\"` - Arctic, north-bluish color palette\n\nPress `t` in interactive mode to cycle through themes at runtime.\n\n#### UI Settings\n\n```toml\n[ui]\n# Default maximum rows to display in non-interactive mode (0 = all)\nmax_rows = 50\n\n# Default maximum column width in characters\ncolumn_width = 30\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- `max_rows` only affects non-interactive display mode (`xleak file.xlsx`)\n- Interactive TUI mode (`-i`) always shows all rows with lazy loading for large files\n- `column_width` applies to both modes and can be overridden with `-w` flag\n\n#### Keybindings\n\nxleak supports two built-in profiles plus custom keybindings:\n\n```toml\n[keybindings]\n# Profile: \"default\" or \"vim\"\nprofile = \"default\"\n\n# Optional: override individual keys\n[keybindings.custom]\nquit = \"x\"\nsearch = \"?\"\ncopy_cell = \"y\"\n```\n\n### Keybinding Profiles\n\n#### Default Profile\n\nStandard keybindings for terminal applications:\n\n| Action | Key | Description |\n|--------|-----|-------------|\n| **Navigation** |

Keep all your credentials and local configuration in `conf/local/`\r\n\r\n## How to install dependencies\r\n\r\nDeclare any dependencies in `requirements.txt` for `pip` installation.\r\n\r\nTo install them, run:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install -r requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to run your Kedro pipeline\r\n\r\nYou can run your Kedro project with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkedro run\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to test your Kedro project\r\n\r\nHave a look at the files `tests/test_run.py` and `tests/pipelines/data_science/test_pipeline.py` for instructions on how to write your tests. Run the tests as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\npytest\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can configure the coverage threshold in your project's `pyproject.toml` file under the `[tool.coverage.report]` section.\r\n\r\n## Project dependencies\r\n\r\nTo see and update the dependency requirements for your project use `requirements.txt`. Install the project requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\r\n\r\n[Further information about project dependencies](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/kedro_project_setup/dependencies.html#project-specific-dependencies)\r\n\r\n## How to work with Kedro and notebooks\r\n\r\n> Note: Using `kedro jupyter` or `kedro ipython` to run your notebook provides these variables in scope: `catalog`, `context`, `pipelines` and `session`.\r\n>\r\n> Jupyter, JupyterLab, and IPython are already included in the project requirements by default, so once you have run `pip install -r requirements.txt` you will not need to take any extra steps before you use them.\r\n\r\n### Jupyter\r\nTo use Jupyter notebooks in your Kedro project, you need to install Jupyter:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install jupyter\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter installing Jupyter, you can start a local notebook server:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkedro jupyter notebook\r\n```\r\n\r\n### JupyterLab\r\nTo use JupyterLab, you need to install it:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install jupyterlab\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also start JupyterLab:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkedro jupyter lab\r\n```\r\n\r\n### IPython\r\nAnd if you want to run an IPython session:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkedro ipython\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How to ignore notebook output cells in `git`\r\nTo automatically strip out all output cell contents before committing to `git`, you can use tools like [`nbstripout`](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout). For example, you can add a hook in `.git/config` with `nbstripout --install`. This will run `nbstripout` before anything is committed to `git`.\r\n\r\n> *Note:* Your output cells will be retained locally.\r\n\r\n## Package your Kedro project\r\n\r\n[Further information about building project documentation and packaging your project](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/tutorial/package_a_project.html)\r\n"

It uses strong typing with comprehensive error handling and is built on Tokio for async operations. The client includes configurable retry logic with exponential backoff and provides an ergonomic API with builder patterns.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nzeroentropy-community = \"0.1.1\"\ntokio = { version = \"1.0\", features = [\"full\"] }\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```rust\nuse zeroentropy_community::Client;\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    // Create client from ZEROENTROPY_API_KEY environment variable\n    let client = Client::from_env()?;\n\n    // Create a collection\n    client.collections().add(\"my_collection\").await?;\n\n    // Add a document\n    client.documents().add_text(\n        \"my_collection\",\n        \"doc1.txt\",\n        \"Rust is a systems programming language.\",\n        None,\n    ).await?;\n\n    // Search documents\n    let results = client.queries().top_snippets(\n        \"my_collection\",\n        \"systems programming\",\n        10,\n        None,\n        None,\n        None,\n        None,\n    ).await?;\n\n    for result in results.results {\n        println!(\"{}: {}\", result.path, result.content);\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Environment Variables\n\n- `ZEROENTROPY_API_KEY` - Your API key (required)\n- `ZEROENTROPY_BASE_URL` - Custom API base URL (optional)\n\n### Client Builder\n\nFor advanced configuration, use the client builder:\n\n```rust\nuse zeroentropy_community::Client;\nuse std::time::Duration;\n\nlet client = Client::builder()\n    .api_key(\"your-api-key\")\n    .timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))\n    .max_retries(3)\n    .build()?;\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Collections\n\n```rust\n// Create a collection\nclient.collections().add(\"my_collection\").await?;\n\n// List all collections\nlet collections = client.collections().get_list().await?;\nfor name in collections.collection_names {\n    println!(\"Collection: {}\", name);\n}\n\n// Delete a collection\nclient.collections().delete(\"my_collection\").await?;\n```\n\n### Documents\n\n#### Adding Text Documents\n\n```rust\nclient.documents().add_text(\n    \"my_collection\",\n    \"document.txt\",\n    \"Your document text here\",\n    None,\n).await?;\n```\n\n#### Adding Documents with Metadata\n\n```rust\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\nuse zeroentropy_community::MetadataValue;\n\nlet mut metadata = HashMap::new();\nmetadata.insert(\n    \"category\".to_string(),\n    MetadataValue::String(\"tutorial\".to_string()),\n);\n\nclient.documents().add_text(\n    \"my_collection\",\n    \"tutorial.txt\",\n    \"Tutorial content\",\n    Some(metadata),\n).await?;\n```\n\n#### Adding PDF Documents\n\n```rust\n// From base64 encoded data\nclient.documents().add_pdf(\n    \"my_collection\",\n    \"document.pdf\",\n    base64_pdf_data,\n    None,\n).await?;\n\n// Directly from file\nclient.documents().add_pdf_file(\n    \"my_collection\",\n    \"document.pdf\",\n    \"/path/to/file.pdf\",\n    None,\n).await?;\n```\n\n#### Managing Documents\n\n```rust\n// Get document info\nlet info = client.documents().get_info(\n    \"my_collection\",\n    \"document.txt\",\n    Some(true), // include content\n).await?;\n\n// Update document metadata\nclient.documents().update(\n    \"my_collection\",\n    \"document.txt\",\n    Some(new_metadata),\n    None,\n).await?;\n\n// Delete document\nclient.documents().delete(\n    \"my_collection\",\n    \"document.txt\",\n).await?;\n```\n\n### Queries\n\n#### Top Documents\n\n```rust\nlet results = client.queries().top_documents(\n    \"my_collection\",\n    \"your search query\",\n    10, // number of results\n    None, // filter\n    Some(true), // include metadata\n    None, // latency mode\n    None, // reranker\n).await?;\n\nfor doc in results.results {\n    println!(\"{}: score {}\", doc.path, doc.score);\n}\n```\n\n#### Top Snippets\n\n```rust\nlet results = client.queries().top_snippets(\n    \"my_collection\",\n    \"your search query\",\n    10,\n    None, // filter\n    Some(true), // include document metadata\n    Some(true), // precise responses (longer snippets)\n    None, // reranker\n).await?;\n\nfor snippet in results.results {\n    println!(\"{}:\\n{}\\n\", snippet.path, snippet.content);\n}\n```\n\n#### Top Pages\n\n```rust\nlet results = client.queries().top_pages(\n    \"my_collection\",\n    \"your search query\",\n    10,\n    None, // filter\n    Some(true), // include content\n    None, // latency mode\n).await?;\n\nfor page in results.results {\n    println!(\"Page {} of {}\", page.page_index, page.path);\n}\n```\n\n### Filtering\n\nUse metadata filters to narrow down search results:\n\n```rust\nuse serde_json::json;\n\nlet filter = json!({\n    \"category\": { \"$eq\": \"tutorial\" }\n}).as_object().unwrap().clone();\n\nlet results = client.queries().top_snippets(\n    \"my_collection\",\n    \"search query\",\n    10,\n    Some(filter),\n    None,\n    None,\n    None,\n).await?;\n```\n\n### Reranking\n\nImprove search result quality with reranking:\n\n```rust\nuse zeroentropy_community::RerankDocument;\n\nlet documents = vec![\n    RerankDocument {\n        id: \"doc1\".to_string(),\n        text: \"First document text\".to_string(),\n    },\n    RerankDocument {\n        id: \"doc2\".to_string(),\n        text: \"Second document text\".to_string(),\n    },\n];\n\nlet results = client.models().rerank(\n    \"your query\",\n    documents,\n    None, // model_id (uses default)\n    Some(5), // top_k\n).await?;\n\nfor result in results.results {\n    println!(\"{}: score {}\", result.id, result.score);\n}\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThe SDK provides specific error types for different failure scenarios:\n\n```rust\nuse zeroentropy_community::Error;\n\nmatch client.collections().add(\"my_collection\").await {\n    Ok(_) => println!(\"Success!\"),\n    Err(Error::Conflict(msg)) => println!(\"Already exists: {}\", msg),\n    Err(Error::NotFound(msg)) => println!(\"Not found: {}\", msg),\n    Err(Error::AuthenticationError(msg)) => println!(\"Auth failed: {}\", msg),\n    Err(Error::RateLimitExceeded(msg)) => println!(\"Rate limited: {}\", msg),\n    Err(e) => println!(\"Error: {}\", e),\n}\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nCheck out the [examples](examples/) directory for complete examples:\n\n### Basic Examples\n-
