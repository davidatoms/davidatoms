    "readme": "## About\n\n[![Run tests](https://github.com/nwb-extensions/ndx-template/actions/workflows/run_tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nwb-extensions/ndx-template/actions/workflows/run_tests.yml)\n\nThis repo provides a template for creating Neurodata Extensions (NDX) for the\n[Neurodata Without Borders](https://nwb.org/)\n data standard.\n\nThis template currently supports creating Neurodata Extensions only using Python 3.9+.\nMATLAB support is in development.\n\n## Getting started\n\n1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your operating system if it is not already installed.\n\n2. Install [cookiecutter](https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter/), [pynwb](https://pypi.org/project/pynwb/), and [hdmf-docutils](https://pypi.org/project/hdmf-docutils/).\n`cookiecutter` is a Python-based command-line utility that creates projects from templates.\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install -U cookiecutter pynwb hdmf-docutils\n   ```\n3. Run cookiecutter in the directory where you want to create a new directory with the extension:\n   ```bash\n   cookiecutter gh:nwb-extensions/ndx-template\n   ```\n\n   To overwrite the contents of an existing directory, use the `--overwrite-if-exists` flag:\n   ```bash\n   cookiecutter --overwrite-if-exists gh:nwb-extensions/ndx-template\n   ```\n   This can be useful if you want to populate an existing empty git repository with a new extension.\n   \n4. Answer the prompts, which will be used to fill in the blanks throughout the\ntemplate automatically. Guidelines:\n    - `Select a name for your extension. It must start with 'ndx-'` - The name of the namespace for your extension. This could be a\n    description of the extension (e.g., \"ndx-cortical-surface\") or the name of your\n    lab or group (e.g., \"ndx-allen-institute\"). The name should generally follow the following naming conventions:\n      - Use only lower-case ASCII letters (no special characters)\n      - Use \"-\" to separate different parts of the name (no spaces allowed)\n      - Be short and descriptive\n    - `Select an initial version string` - Version of your extension. Versioning should start at 0.1.0 and follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines\n    - `Select a license` - Name of license used for your extension source code. A permissive license, such as BSD, should be used if possible.\n5. A new folder with the same name as your entered `namespace` will be\ncreated. See `NEXTSTEPS.md` in that folder for the next steps in creating\nyour awesome new Neurodata Extension.\n\nIn case cookiecutter runs into problems and you want to avoid reentering\nall the information, you can edit the file `~/.cookiecutter_replay/ndx-template.json`,\nand use that via `cookiecutter --replay gh:nwb-extensions/ndx-template`.\n\nSee the [PyNWB tutorial](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/general/extensions.html) for guidance on how to write your extension.\n\nWhen you are done creating your extension, we encourage you to follow the steps\nto publish your Neurodata Extension in the [NDX Catalog](https://github.com/nwb-extensions/) for the benefit of the\ngreater neuroscience community! :)\n\n## Running tests with breakpoint debugging\n\nBy default, to aid with debugging, the project is configured NOT to run code coverage as part of the tests. Code coverage testing is useful to help with creation of tests and report test coverage. However, with this option enabled, breakpoints for debugging with pdb are being ignored. To enable this option for code coverage reporting, uncomment out the following line in your `pyproject.toml`:\n\nhttps://github.com/nwb-extensions/ndx-template/blob/11ae225b3fd3934fa3c56e6e7b563081793b3b43/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.namespace%20%7D%7D/pyproject.toml#L82-L83\n\n## Integrating with NWB Widgets\n\nWhen answering the cookiecutter prompts, you will be asked whether you would like to create templates for integration with [NWB Widgets](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwbwidgets), a library of plotting widgets for interactive visualization of NWB neurodata types within a Jupyter notebook. If you answer \"yes\", then an example widget and example notebook will be created for you. If you answer \"no\", but would like to add a widget later on, follow the instructions below:\n\n1. Create a directory named `widgets` in `src/pynwb/{your_python_package_name}/`.\n2. Copy [`__init__.py`](https://github.com/nwb-extensions/ndx-template/blob/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.namespace%20%7D%7D/src/pynwb/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.py_pkg_name%20%7D%7D/widgets/__init__.py) to that directory and adapt the contents to your extension.\n3. Copy [`tetrode_series_widget.py`](https://github.com/nwb-extensions/ndx-template/blob/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.namespace%20%7D%7D/src/pynwb/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.py_pkg_name%20%7D%7D/widgets/tetrode_series_widget.py) to that directory and adapt the contents to your extension.\n4. Create a directory named `notebooks` in the root of the repository.\n5. Copy [example.ipynb](https://github.com/nwb-extensions/ndx-template/blob/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.namespace%20%7D%7D/notebooks/example.ipynb) to that directory and adapt the contents to your extension.\n6. Add `nwbwidgets` to the `[project] dependencies` or `[project.optional-dependencies]` section of `pyproject.toml`.\n\n## Maintainers\n- [@rly](https://github.com/rly)\n- [@oruebel](https://github.com/oruebel)\n- [@jcfr](https://github.com/jcfr)\n- [@bendichter](https://github.com/bendichter)\n- [@ajtritt](https://github.com/ajtritt)\n\n## Copyright\n\nNeurodata Extensions Catalog (NDX Catalog) Copyright (c) 2021-2025,\nThe Regents of the University of California, through Lawrence\nBerkeley National Laboratory (subject to receipt of any required\napprovals from the U.S. Dept. of Energy).

Record your life, remember people you meet, identify objects, translate text, and more.\n\n![OpenGlass](https://github.com/BasedHardware/OpenGlass/assets/43514161/2fdc9d9d-2206-455c-ba60-10dbd6fb3dfb)\n\n\n## Video Demo\n\n[![OpenGlass Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/DsM_-c2e1ew/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/DsM_-c2e1ew)\n\n## Want a Pre-built Version?\n\nWe will ship a limited number of pre-built kits. Fill out the [interest form](https://basedhardware.com/openglass) to get notified.\n\n## Community\n\nJoin the [Based Hardware Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ZutWMTJnwA) for setup questions, contribution guide, and more.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFollow these steps to set up OpenGlass:\n\n### Hardware\n\n1. Gather the required components:\n   - [Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32 S3 Sense](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C69FFVHH/ref=dp_iou_view_item?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\n   - [EEMB LP502030 3.7v 250mAH battery](https://www.amazon.com/EEMB-Battery-Rechargeable-Lithium-Connector/dp/B08VRZTHDL)\n   - [3D printed glasses mount case](https://storage.googleapis.com/scott-misc/openglass_case.stl)\n\n2. 3D print the glasses mount case using the provided STL file.\n\n3. Open the [firmware folder](https://github.com/BasedHardware/openglass/tree/main/firmware) and open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.\n   - If you don't have the Arduino IDE installed, download and install it from the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).\n   - Alternatively, follow the steps in the [firmware readme](firmware/readme.md) to build using `arduino-cli`\n\n4. Follow the software preparation steps to set up the Arduino IDE for the XIAO ESP32S3 board:\n   - Add ESP32 board package to your Arduino IDE:\n     - Navigate to File > Preferences, and fill \"Additional Boards Manager URLs\" with the URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json`\n     - Navigate to Tools > Board > Boards Manager..., type the keyword `esp32` in the search box, select the latest version of `esp32`, and install it.\n   - Select your board and port:\n     - On top of the Arduino IDE, select the port (likely to be COM3 or higher).\n     - Search for `xiao` in the development board on the left and select `XIAO_ESP32S3`.\n\n5. Before you flash go to the \"Tools\" drop down in the Arduino IDE and make sure you set \"PSRAM:\" to be \"PSRAM: \"OPI PSRAM\"\n\n![Like this](image.png)\n\n6. Upload the firmware to the XIAO ESP32S3 board.\n\n### Software\n\n1. Clone the OpenGlass repository and install the dependencies:\n   ```\n   git clone https://github.com/BasedHardware/openglass.git\n   cd openglass\n   npm install\n   ```\n   You can also use **yarn** to install, by doing\n   ```\n   yarn install\n   ```\n\n3. Add API keys for Groq and OpenAI in the `keys.ts` file located at [https://github.com/BasedHardware/OpenGlass/blob/main/sources/keys.ts](https://github.com/BasedHardware/OpenGlass/blob/main/sources/keys.ts).\n\n4. For Ollama, self-host the REST API from the repository at [https://github.com/ollama/ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) and add the URL to the `keys.ts` file. The URL should be http://localhost:11434/api/chat\n5. go to terminal and type \"ollama pull moondream:1.8b-v2-fp16\"\n\n\n6. Start the application:\n   ```\n   npm start\n   ```\n\n   If using **yarn** start the application with\n   ```\n   yarn start\n   ```\n\n   Note: This is an Expo project. For now, open the localhost link (this will appear after completing step 5) to access the web version.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n## [\u2139\ufe0f \ud83d\udd34 We moved this project to Omi repository.

For example, the [node debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-debug) and the [mono debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mono-debug) repositories are separate from each other. For a complete list, please visit the [Related Projects](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) page on our [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki).\n\n## Bundled Extensions\n\nVS Code includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (code completion, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix `language-features`. For example, the `json` extension provides coloring for `JSON` and the `json-language-features` extension provides rich language support for `JSON`.\n\n## Development Container\n\nThis repository includes a Visual Studio Code Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container.\n\n* For [Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers), use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.\n  * If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can also click [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) to get started. This will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.\n\n* For Codespaces, install the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension in VS Code, and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.\n\nDocker / the Codespace should have at least **4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)** to run full build. See the [development container README](.devcontainer/README.md) for more information.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
